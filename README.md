# 💡 LANtern – Wake-on-LAN Web App

**LANtern** is a lightweight, user-friendly web application that allows you to power on computers or devices in your local network using **Wake-on-LAN (WoL)** magic packets. Built with Flask (Python) and SQLite, it gives you a simple interface to store device info and trigger wakeups from any browser on your network.
